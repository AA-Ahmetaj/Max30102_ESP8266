This is a small scale project that incorporates the use of a DHT11 sensor, MAX30102 sensor, a Servo Motor and an ESP8266 for data transmission. It makes use of the 
DFROBOT_MAX30102.h library, which can be found on the repository with the same name. The data is transmitted wirelessly and send to a google spreadsheet for vizualization. 
On this repository you will find the ESP8266 code to be uploaded to the NodeMCU, and the JavaScript code used to get the data to the Google Spreadsheet. 
In order to setup a Google Spreadsheet accordingly, open a Google Spreadsheet and name the first cells of the colons A-F as Date, Time, Temperature, Humidity, SPO2 and BPM respectively.
Then go to "Extensions" and select "Apps Script" from the dropdown menu. Copy and paste "Spreadsheet_code.css" into the pop up window. On the line 8, update the sheet id with id 
of your current spreadsheet. To get the sheet id, check you Goggle Spreadhsset link. For example, if your preadsheet link is 
"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13423135sdfdsfsd321ds354dsf12sdf/edit#gid=0" then your sheet id is "107th8XQ5M0CZQEtP5-WBznHtZDZ0X7juvxvB1yzb-BE".
After you have done that, you select "Deploy", select "New Deployment" and give access to "Anyone". You confrim your deployment by hitting "Deploy" again and then your Deployment ID 
will be generated. 
Afterwards, you want to setup your NodeMCU. In order to do that copy and paste the "ESP8266.h" code into your Arduino IDE or a similar IDE. Make sure you have downloaded and selected 
the right typr of Board. For this project I used the "NODE MCU 1.0 (ESP 12E Module"). In that code, update teh variable GAS_ID with the Deployment ID obtained earlier. Then provide
the SSID and password to your current WiFi network on the respective lines. Upload the code to your NodeMCU and wire the circuit as mentioned on the code comments.
